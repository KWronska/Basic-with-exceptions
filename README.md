# Basic-with-exceptions
Just a try-out for Python coding with try:... except:.. 

In general working on Udemy course 100-Days----Challenge I have a few programs to complete each and every day.
This is one of them.

The idea is to calculate the values choosen by user. I used this code to better understand try...except... rule.
